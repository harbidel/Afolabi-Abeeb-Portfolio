# My Data Science/Machine Learning Portfolio

# [Project 1: Mosquito-on-human-skin-prediction-model](https://github.com/harbidel/Mosquito-on-human-skin-prediction-model)
Bulding a simple CNN multi image classifier model to predict the presence of mosquito on human skin using transfer Learning (VGG16).

* VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.

# [Project 2: Heart-Failure-Prediction](https://github.com/harbidel/Heart-Failure-Prediction/tree/main)
Heart Failure Classification Prediction using Different machine learning Prediction ssuch as:
* Logistic Regression
* K nearest Neigbough Classifier
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Random Forest Classsifier
* Neural Networks (ANN)

# [Project 3: Movie-Recommendation-Model](https://github.com/harbidel/Movie-Recommendation-Model)
## Building a Movie Recommendation Model with Matrix Factorization
### Summary

This dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

The data are contained in the files `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a *development* dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available *benchmark* datasets if that is your intent.

This and other GroupLens data sets are publicly available for download at <http://grouplens.org/datasets/>.

# [Project 4: ASR_Nigeria_Pidgin_Workbook](https://github.com/harbidel/ASR_Nigeria_Pidgin_Workbook/tree/main)
Towards end-end Training of Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian Pidgin

# [project 5: Machine-Learning-Web-App](https://github.com/harbidel/Machine-Learning-Web-App)
Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit, Sci-kit learn and Matplotlib
* In this Project I build an interactive machine learning app with Streamlit and Scikit-learn to explore different datasets and classifier. 
* This project demonstrate how easy interactive web applications can be build with Streamlit. 
### Streamlit lets you create beautiful apps for your machine learning projects with simple Python scripts.

# Hotel_Management_db
Hotel Management Database using Oracle DB

### Scenario:
The scenario is a Hotel Management System that caters to a hotel chain with multiple properties. The system will handle various aspects of hotel operations, including room reservations, guest information, staff management, and billing.

### Business Rules:
* Each hotel property can have multiple rooms.
*	A guest can make a reservation for a specific room in a hotel.
*	A room can have multiple reservations over time.
*	Each reservation is associated with a specific guest.
*	The hotel staff can manage room availability, check-ins, and check-outs.
*	The billing department generates invoices for guest stays.

### Data Involved:
*	Hotels: Information about each hotel property, including its name, location, and contact details.
*	Rooms: Details about each room, such as room number, room type, and room capacity.
*	Guests: Information about guests, including their name, contact details, and nationality.
*	Reservations: Data related to each reservation, including the check-in date, check-out date, and reservation status.
*	Invoices: Details about the invoices generated for guest stays, including invoice number, total amount, and payment status.
