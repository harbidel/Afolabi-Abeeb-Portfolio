# Project 1: Mosquito-on-human-skin-prediction-model
Bulding a simple CNN multi image classifier model to predict the presence of mosquito on human skin using transfer Learning (VGG16).

* VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.
