# [Project 3: Movie Recommendation Model](https://github.com/harbidel/Movie-Recommendation-Model)
## Building a Movie Recommendation Model with Matrix Factorization
### Summary

This dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

The data are contained in the files `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a *development* dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available *benchmark* datasets if that is your intent.

This and other GroupLens data sets are publicly available for download at <http://grouplens.org/datasets/>.

# [Project 4: ASR Nigeria Pidgin Workbook](https://github.com/harbidel/ASR_Nigeria_Pidgin_Workbook/tree/main)
Towards end-end Training of Automatic Speech Recognition for Nigerian Pidgin
* In this work, we present the first parallel data on Nigerian pidgin 
* Trained the first end to end speech recognition systems (QuartzNet and Jasper) on this language
* Open-sourced the data and code to encourage future research in this direction
* Using our unique dataset, we fine-tuned different variants of the WacaVec2.o architecture 
* Empirically, we achieved a lower word error rate on the test set, outperforming the baseline method, and also surpassed other variants of the WacaVec2.0 architecture in terms of qualitative assessments.


# [Project 5: Machine Learning Web App](https://github.com/harbidel/Machine-Learning-Web-App)
Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit, Sci-kit learn and Matplotlib
* In this Project I build an interactive machine learning app with Streamlit and Scikit-learn to explore different datasets and classifier. 
* This project demonstrate how easy interactive web applications can be build with Streamlit. 

Streamlit lets you create beautiful apps for your machine learning projects with simple Python scripts.

# [Project 6: Hotel Management Database System](https://github.com/harbidel/Hotel_Management_db)
Hotel Management Database using Oracle DB

### Scenario:
The scenario is a Hotel Management System that caters to a hotel chain with multiple properties. The system will handle various aspects of hotel operations, including room reservations, guest information, staff management, and billing.

### Business Rules:
* Each hotel property can have multiple rooms.
*	A guest can make a reservation for a specific room in a hotel.
*	A room can have multiple reservations over time.
*	Each reservation is associated with a specific guest.
*	The hotel staff can manage room availability, check-ins, and check-outs.
*	The billing department generates invoices for guest stays.

### Data Involved:
*	Hotels: Information about each hotel property, including its name, location, and contact details.
*	Rooms: Details about each room, such as room number, room type, and room capacity.
*	Guests: Information about guests, including their name, contact details, and nationality.
*	Reservations: Data related to each reservation, including the check-in date, check-out date, and reservation status.
*	Invoices: Details about the invoices generated for guest stays, including invoice number, total amount, and payment status.

# [Project 7: Lung Cancer Model Deploy to Live Production](https://github.com/harbidel/Lung-Cancer-Model-Deploy-to-Production)
Deploying Lung Cancer Machine Learning model to web Applications

Using scikit-learn, pickle, Flask, Microsoft Azure and ipywidgets to fully deploy a Python machine learning algorithm into a live, production environment

## Steps
* Step 1: Develop a Machine Learning Algorithm
* Step 2: Make an Individual Prediction from the Trained Model
* Step 3: Develop a Web Service Wrapper
* Step 4: Deploy the Web Service to Microsoft Azure
* Step 5: Building a Client Application to Consume the Azure-deployed Web Service

# [Project 8: My Blog App](https://github.com/harbidel/blog-app)
My Blog App with Django

# [Project 9: House Price Prediction Deployment](https://github.com/harbidel/House-Price-Prediction-Deployment)
Deployment of the House Price Sales prediction Using Flask

For this work, I will be using linear regression to predict the sales value in the third month using rate of interest and sales of the first two months.

## Project Structure
This project has four parts:

* model.py — This contains code for the machine learning model to predict sales in the third month based on the sales in the first two months.
* app.py — This contains Flask APIs that receives sales details through GUI or API calls, computes the predicted value based on our model and returns it.
* request.py — This uses requests module to call APIs defined in app.py and displays the returned value.
* HTML/CSS — This contains the HTML template and CSS styling to allow user to enter sales detail and displays the predicted sales in the third month.

# [Stacked Sack Counting](https://github.com/harbidel/Stacked-Sack-Counting)
Counting of Stacked sacks using Computer Vision

## Procedure
* Collect images of stacked sacks: You will need a variety of images of stacked sacks in different orientations and lighting conditions.
* Preprocess the images: This may involve resizing the images, converting them to grayscale, and removing noise.
* Use a computer vision algorithm to count the number of sacks: There are a number of different algorithms that you can use, such as edge detection, object detection, and image segmentation.
* Evaluate the results: Once you have counted the number of sacks in the images, you need to evaluate the results to make sure that they are accurate.
