# [Project 1: Mosquito-on-human-skin-prediction-model](https://github.com/harbidel/Mosquito-on-human-skin-prediction-model)
Bulding a simple CNN multi image classifier model to predict the presence of mosquito on human skin using transfer Learning (VGG16).

* VGG16 is object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories with 92.7% accuracy. It is one of the popular algorithms for image classification and is easy to use with transfer learning.

# [Project 2: Heart-Failure-Prediction](https://github.com/harbidel/Heart-Failure-Prediction/tree/main)
Heart Failure Classification Prediction using Different machine learning Prediction ssuch as:
* Logistic Regression
* K nearest Neigbough Classifier
* Naive Bayes Classifier
* Random Forest Classsifier
* Neural Networks (ANN)

# [Project 3: Movie-Recommendation-Model](https://github.com/harbidel/Movie-Recommendation-Model)
## Building a Movie Recommendation Model with Matrix Factorization
### Summary

This dataset (ml-latest-small) describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

The data are contained in the files `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a *development* dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available *benchmark* datasets if that is your intent.

This and other GroupLens data sets are publicly available for download at <http://grouplens.org/datasets/>.
